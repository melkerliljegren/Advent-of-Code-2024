# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-1%2F25%20days-blue)

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).  
My goal is to practice problem solving, algorithmic thinking, and improve my ability to write clean and efficient Python code while also getting more comfortable with Git and GitHub.

## Structure

Each day has its own folder:

day01/
input.txt
part1.py
part2.py
README.md

day02/
input.txt
part1.py
part2.py
README.md

- `input.txt` contains the puzzle input.
- `part1.py` and `part2.py` contains my solutions for the day.
- `README.md` contains the puzzle of the day

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.12+
- **Libraries:** Standard library only (unless otherwise noted)
- **Version Control:** Each day is committed separately to track progress.
